//Q. No. of Trailing zeros

// as no. of 2s is always greater that no. of 5s in a factorial

// and a 10=2*5

// so our as is going to be the number of 5s in factorial

// n/5+n/5^2+n/n^3...
// untill n exist

// n/5^2 will count 5s for 25 val

// n/5^3 will count 5s for 125 val





//Q.Repeat and Missing Number Array
// You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.
