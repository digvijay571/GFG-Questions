//Stack works on LIFO model -Abstastract Datastructure
//we get elements in reversed order .
//eg if we push 1,2,3,4 we will get 4,3,2,1 
//push,pop,top,empty,size

//Stack works on FIFO model -Abstastract Datastructure
//we get elements in same order in which it is inserted.
//eg if we push 1,2,3,4 we will get 1,2,3,4 
//push,pop,top,empty,size


//Some time i forget to push or pop elements or check if stack is empty and access top directly

//Value stack
//Index stack
